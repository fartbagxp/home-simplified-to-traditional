# murray-simplified-to-traditional
This project is a utility project for a home entertainment center to convert utf8 simplified chinese files to traditional chinese files.

It uses a simple converter that takes an input file (in utf-8) form, and attempts to convert all the text in it with simplified chinese characters to traditional chinese characters (in Hong Kong region).
